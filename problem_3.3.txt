Add substract, multiply, and divide mehtods to the fraction 
class (section 3.8). Also, add two more constructors. One
of the constructor will have no parameters; it initializes the
fraction to 0/1. The other constructor will have one parameter,
representing the numerator of the fraction; the denominator will
be 1. Write a test fraction class that creates two Fraction objects
and tests the behavior of all constructor and instance methods
in the Fraction class.
